# Real-Time EV Fleet Monitoring and Predictive Analytics Solution

## Overview

The **Real-Time EV Fleet Monitoring and Predictive Analytics Solution** is a comprehensive platform designed to track and manage Electric Vehicle (EV) fleets. The solution provides real-time monitoring of vehicle status, battery health, route optimization, and driver behavior analysis. It also includes predictive analytics to forecast maintenance needs and optimize fleet operations.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time EV Registration and Monitoring**: Tracks vehicle location, speed, battery health, and other parameters.
- **Route Optimization**: Suggests optimal routes based on real-time battery status and nearby charging stations.
- **Driver Behavior Analysis**: Tracks driving patterns and provides feedback on driver behavior.
- **Maintenance Alerts**: Predictive alerts for vehicle maintenance based on usage and behavior.
- **Customizable Reporting**: Generates reports for fleet management and performance analytics.
